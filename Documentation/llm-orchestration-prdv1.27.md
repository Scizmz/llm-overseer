  4. **State Transfer**: 
     - Encrypted transfer of state package
     - Verification of successful receipt
     - Acknowledgment from new orchestrator
  5. **Authority Transfer**:
     - Update all models with new orchestrator identity
     - Transfer authentication tokens
     - Update routing tables
  6. **Resumption**:
     - New orchestrator validates state
     - Confirms model connections
     - Resumes task distribution
     - Logs handoff completion
  
- **In-Flight Request Handling**:
  - Active requests tagged with orchestrator ID
  - Responses routed to originating orchestrator
  - Graceful timeout with automatic retry
  - State synchronization for completed tasks
  
- **Authentication Continuity**:

- **Orchestrator conflicts**: Use consensus algorithms for leader election

### Operational Risks
- **Model downtime**: Implement failover mechanisms
- **Cost overruns**: Usage monitoring and alerts
- **Scalability issues**: Load testing and capacity planning
- **Service interruptions**: Automatic state recovery and task resumption
- **Data loss**: Multi-region replication and continuous backups
